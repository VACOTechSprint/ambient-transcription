# VA AI Tech Sprint 4 - Provider Burnout Solution

Welcome to the project management repository for our VA AI Tech Sprint 4 challenge entry, where we aim to tackle provider burnout through innovative AI-powered solutions. This README provides an overview of our project, instructions for contributors, and resources for our collaborators.

## About the Project

The Department of Veterans Affairs has initiated a competition to harness the potential of AI to reduce provider burnout and improve care for our veterans. Our team is developing an ambient dictation tool that intelligently transcribes and summarizes healthcare interactions, leveraging open-source technology and cloud-based solutions. 

Our goal is to create a product that not only meets the stringent requirements set forth by the VA but also embodies the principles of ethical AI and open-source collaboration.

## Project Structure
- `/docs`: Documentations, including competition requirements, guidelines, and rubrics.
- `/src`: Source code for the transcription and diarization engine.
- `/webapp`: Progressive web application front-end for recording and displaying transcriptions.
- `/deployment`: Configuration and documentation for deploying the application to cloud environments.
- `/design`: Mockups and design resources for the web application.
